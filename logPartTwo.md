# 100 Days Of Code - Finish strong, no matter what!

### Day 0: April 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorial on Codecademy, managed to make an infinite loop for the first time. Not sure how to fix it.

**Thoughts:** I made it past day 80 in 100 days of code, and then I fell off the wagon. So I am getting back on the horse and coding for 30 days. It's gonna go fine. I am so confident right now. I just lost track for a bit. No reason not to finish this. I didn't realize it's been about a month since I've actually committed anything to Git...except for one day. I defintely have coded, but I haven't been here in a while. It's good to be back.

**Thoughts:** Still having problems with the while loop. But I've enjoyed doing these tutorials as review. I need to get back on the watch and code train. I have a feeling tomorrow will be a lot of coding at home. I'm looking forward to it. Also I talked to Elyse. She's gonna help me with some networking, so I'm looking forward to that.
