# 100 Days Of Code - Finish strong, no matter what!

### Day 0: April 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorial on Codecademy, managed to make an infinite loop for the first time. Not sure how to fix it.

**Thoughts:** I made it past day 80 in 100 days of code, and then I fell off the wagon. So I am getting back on the horse and coding for 30 days. It's gonna go fine. I am so confident right now. I just lost track for a bit. No reason not to finish this. I didn't realize it's been about a month since I've actually committed anything to Git...except for one day. I defintely have coded, but I haven't been here in a while. It's good to be back.

### Day 1: April 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorials on Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Still having problems with the while loop. But I've enjoyed doing these tutorials as review. I need to get back on the watch and code train. I have a feeling tomorrow will be a lot of coding at home. I'm looking forward to it. Also I talked to Elyse. She's gonna help me with some networking, so I'm looking forward to that.

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorials on Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Still cranking along. I was pretty busy today, so I didn't do as much as I would've liked, but still did something! Time for a new week. Tomorrow is the Hack Reactor webinar, so that's exciting.

### Day 4: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I did more JS review, and also sat in on a webinar for Hack Reactor.

**Thoughts:** I am definitely going to apply. I just need to get my ducks in a row. I think if I don't get in this round or get a scholarship, I will apply for the October round and see what happens. But I would only do this in August if I get the scholarship. But definitely would do in October. I might actually do more application stuff before I go to bed tonight...

### Day 5: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS in Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Today I learned a new method: for (var key in object) {} which basically cycles through each key of an object. I used it to log each key, and then I use it to create a search function. I can see how that might be helpful in JSON. I also did some work on my Hack Reactor Scholarship. I need to put together the application ASAP. I am super motivated in spite of all the other stuff I have going on in my life right now though. Also I think I'm obsessed with writing good documentation.
