# 100 Days Of Code - Finish strong, no matter what!

### Day 0: April 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorial on Codecademy, managed to make an infinite loop for the first time. Not sure how to fix it.

**Thoughts:** I made it past day 80 in 100 days of code, and then I fell off the wagon. So I am getting back on the horse and coding for 30 days. It's gonna go fine. I am so confident right now. I just lost track for a bit. No reason not to finish this. I didn't realize it's been about a month since I've actually committed anything to Git...except for one day. I defintely have coded, but I haven't been here in a while. It's good to be back.

### Day 1: April 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorials on Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Still having problems with the while loop. But I've enjoyed doing these tutorials as review. I need to get back on the watch and code train. I have a feeling tomorrow will be a lot of coding at home. I'm looking forward to it. Also I talked to Elyse. She's gonna help me with some networking, so I'm looking forward to that.

### Day 3: April 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Tutorials on Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Still cranking along. I was pretty busy today, so I didn't do as much as I would've liked, but still did something! Time for a new week. Tomorrow is the Hack Reactor webinar, so that's exciting.

### Day 4: May 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Today I did more JS review, and also sat in on a webinar for Hack Reactor.

**Thoughts:** I am definitely going to apply. I just need to get my ducks in a row. I think if I don't get in this round or get a scholarship, I will apply for the October round and see what happens. But I would only do this in August if I get the scholarship. But definitely would do in October. I might actually do more application stuff before I go to bed tonight...

### Day 5: May 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS in Codecademy

**Thoughts:** Today I learned a new method: for (var key in object) {} which basically cycles through each key of an object. I used it to log each key, and then I use it to create a search function. I can see how that might be helpful in JSON. I also did some work on my Hack Reactor Scholarship. I need to put together the application ASAP. I am super motivated in spite of all the other stuff I have going on in my life right now though. Also I think I'm obsessed with writing good documentation.

### Day 6: May 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Objects in Codecademy

**Thoughts:** It looks like I made no progress, but actually I did quite a bit of object review. I struggled with the switch statment; I should review that more. But I did more practicing constructing objects using the constructor method rather than literal method where you just define the object all at once within the curly braces. Not sure what the benefits are, but it did help me understand this notation a bit better. For example, I've only ever used "this" within an object, but I didn't know you could define it outside and then have it apply to multiple objects when called upon. Pretty cool.

### Day 7: May 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Object Oriented Programming  

**Thoughts:** More fun with objects! Learned some new stuff too, like how to easily construct a bunch of similar objects. And create methods. Probably two more days of this, and I will also be working on my Hack Reactor applications hardcore this weekend.

### Day 8: May 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: JS Object Oriented Programming

**Thoughts:** I am currently breaking my longest github streak! Yay!! Also I did more practice with objects today, and I specifically wrote a function that adds objects to an array. I didn't think of using array[array.length] = Object as a way to add new objects (or anything to the end of an array. I feel like array.push does the same thing... Anyways. New stuff, more tomorrow.
